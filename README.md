Student Profile Portal

I used Figma to create this Student Portal.

Installation:There is no installation required to use Figma.One can go to figma.com and Sign up and it is ready to use.The platform allows us to design app or websites as well as prototype them.

Creating Design:Screens for various devices and any shapes can be created using Frames feature.Any geometrical shapes like circle circle, rectangle, square can be created using shapes feature.Text can be added using test tool.Selection of components can usually be done on the left side of working screen and designing of this components on the right side.This design tool includes a lot of elements likeangle, size, effects, strokes that can be added by the user.
I used the Fill feature from the Design tab to fill in various background colours after choosing an appropriate colour scheme from a colour palette.
This Fill feature also allows us to use images and icons to the background of frames and shapes.
I also created menubar using a frame and added icons of sag format to cancel out white backgrounds.This toolbar helps you to go to the previous screen, next screen as well as home screen.
Components in Figma are basically frames or shapes or collection of them which are reusable.These are very useful to avoid repetition and increase usability.

Prototyping:
Figma enables the user user to prototype his website/app design.User can connect various frames and shapes with each other.It allows to add features horizontal,vertical or both direction scrolling. It allows us to have a pop-up or open an overlay when when we interact with any component.This interactions can be tap, dragging, hovering,etc.These overlays also can be positioned in many ways.I have positioned them manually for better accuracy and better looking interface.Working and Features:
This Student Profile Portal is a management system where a student can add/update and store all of his/her details like academics, clubs, achievements, residential information,skills,projects,internships and research experience.The portal starts with a screen to navigate to student or institute dashboard.
Student Dashboard:
It starts with a login page using Roll No. & Password.Once logged in student can access information from various categories.
Starting with academics,a student can see his CGPA .He can navigate to the next screens  which include his courses taken, current courses and attendances well.
Next is the Residential Details category, wherein his permanent address,hostel details are stored.
In the Clubs category, details about students clubs, his tenure and position there are provided.
In the Skills category, his soft skills and technical skills are available.
Similarly categories like projects, achievements,internships and research work provide detailed description about them.

Additional Features:
It provides all the details of the students across various domains.
Each screen after login page has a feature to go to the previous screen, next screen and homepage.Details about every skill,project,inteenship and research experience is provided using the overlay feature at correct positions.
A student can maintain all his details in various areas with the adding  a new entry feature, and can decide if he wants to keep them public or not that is visible to his institute, fellow students. etc,


Institute Dashboard
The Institute Dashboard allows us to view the Student Record year wise.Here the data, for batch of 2022 can be seen.Details of the student can be viewed, edited or deleted.The institute will only have access to view, edit or delete certain details.For example, the institute will surly have access to the academics record and will be able view or edit it.In some categories like residential details
Student can chose to not make it public.
In this way institute will be able to manage information for all students in a systematic manner.



Features that were not implemented:
I have created an Institute dashboard that enables institute to record the student data.In this case I have filled in the details of one of the students and linked it directly to the Student Dashboard Screens.I wanted to create another portal with a different design for the institute but was unable to do so due to time constraints.Since I have directly connected student’s dashboard in institute dashboard private details,like here residential details are also disclosed, which won’t be the case if an entirely new portal is created.This institute dashboard will have an entirely different design and interface accessible only to the interface.
I also think the institute dashboard also has to be protected and passwords to login should be used.
I was unable to put in more content or details in categories like skills, projects and internships 
 a lot more small details like a search button.
I wanted to add an attendance screen showcasing the student’s attendance by creating and using Pie-charts and Graphs etc.

Difficultoes faced in the completion of task:
It was great learning an entirely new tool for the first time and using it to create an actual app prototype.It was difficult to understand a few prototyping features and use them.In the Institute portal it was difficult to incorporate horizontal level and vertical level scrolling, since it was not visible even after trying to prototype it a lot of times.Currently,the screen is working but the operation is not that smooth.Due to time constraints I was not able to get it right but it is working.


DEMONSTRATION OF PROTOTYPE:
